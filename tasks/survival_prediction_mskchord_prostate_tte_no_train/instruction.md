# mskchord_prostate_tte_no_train

## Overview

Build the strongest survival model you can for patients with prostate cancer. For every held-out patient, predict the time to death or overall survival in
days from the available clinical, demographic, laboratory, and genomic
features.

You may use any modeling approach. Iterate freely; only the final submission
written to `/workspace/submission/predictions.csv` is scored.

## Inputs

The following files are available under `/workspace/data/`:

- `test_examples.csv`: held-out patients with `sample_id` and feature columns,
  but no outcomes.
- `manifest.json`: split metadata and the feature-column list.

No labeled `train.csv` is provided. Missing feature values may be present.

## Output

Write `/workspace/submission/predictions.csv` with exactly these columns:

```csv
sample_id,prediction
```

Each held-out patient `sample_id` must appear exactly once and must match a row
in `test_examples.csv`.

Treat `sample_id` only as an opaque submission key. Do not use its value,
numeric components, ordering, or any transformation of it as input to
prediction, feature engineering, stratification, calibration, or model
selection.

The `prediction` value must be one finite, nonnegative survival time in days.
For example:

```csv
sample_id,prediction
P-0000012,730
```

Integer and decimal values are accepted. Do not include units or explanatory
text in the prediction cell.

## Scoring

The verifier logs the Survprompt TTE_OS metrics:

- Coverage: fraction of expected patients with a unique, parseable time.
- C-index: concordance using shorter predicted survival as higher risk; higher
  is better.
- Censoring-adjusted MAE in years: error of predicted survival time after
  pseudo-observation adjustment for censoring; lower is better.
- Integrated Brier score over the 0.5-to-10-year grid. Each scalar time is
  converted to a deterministic survival curve that is 1 before the predicted
  time and 0 afterward; lower is better.

The final reward is binary. Reward is 1.0 only when:

- Coverage is exactly 100%.
- C-index is strictly higher than both the Cox and RSF baselines.
- Censoring-adjusted MAE is strictly lower than both baselines.
- Integrated Brier score is strictly lower than both baselines.

Any missing, duplicate, unexpected, or malformed prediction prevents a
successful result.

## Constraints

- You have up to one hour.
- Internet access is available.
- Do not attempt to access training outcomes or held-out outcomes. They are not mounted during the
  agent run.
