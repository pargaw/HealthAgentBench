## Overview

Build the strongest survival model you can for patients with non-small cell
lung cancer. For every held-out patient, predict a survival-probability curve
from the available clinical, demographic, laboratory, and genomic features.

You may use any modeling approach. Iterate freely; only the final submission
written to `/workspace/submission/predictions.csv` is scored.

## Inputs

The following files are available under `/workspace/data/`:

- `train.csv`: labeled training patients. It contains `sample_id`, feature
  columns, `observed_time_days`, and `event_observed`.
- `test_examples.csv`: held-out patients with `sample_id` and the same feature
  columns, but no outcomes.
- `manifest.json`: split metadata and the feature-column list.

`event_observed` is true when death was observed and false when the survival
time is right-censored. Missing feature values may be present.

## Output

Write `/workspace/submission/predictions.csv` with exactly these columns:

```csv
sample_id,prediction
```

Each opaque row-level `sample_id` must appear exactly once and must match a
row in `test_examples.csv`. Do not derive or alter these identifiers. The
`prediction` value must be a Python-style list of
`(time_years, survival_probability)` pairs. For example:

```text
[(0.0, 1.0), (0.5, 0.93), (1.0, 0.84), (1.5, 0.76)]
```

For every curve:

- Times must be finite, nonnegative, and strictly increasing.
- Probabilities must be finite and between 0 and 1.
- Probabilities should represent survival through the corresponding time.
- Include enough of the curve to support evaluation from 0.5 through 10 years.

CSV quoting is required because each prediction contains commas. A standard
CSV writer such as `pandas.DataFrame.to_csv(..., index=False)` handles this.

## Scoring

The verifier logs all Survprompt survival-probability metrics:

- Coverage: fraction of expected patients with a unique, parseable curve.
- C-index: concordance based on the area under each predicted survival curve;
  higher is better.
- Censoring-adjusted MAE in years: error of predicted median survival after
  pseudo-observation adjustment for censoring; lower is better.
- Integrated Brier score over the supported 0.5-to-10-year grid; lower is
  better.

The final reward is binary. Reward is 1.0 only when:

- Coverage is exactly 100%.
- C-index is strictly higher than both the Cox and RSF baselines.
- Censoring-adjusted MAE is strictly lower than both baselines.
- Integrated Brier score is strictly lower than both baselines.

Any missing, duplicate, unexpected, or malformed prediction prevents a
successful result.

## Constraints

- You have up to one hour.
- Internet access is available.
- Do not attempt to access held-out outcomes. They are not mounted during the
  agent run.
