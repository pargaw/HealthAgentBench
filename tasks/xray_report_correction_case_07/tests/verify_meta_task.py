"""Harbor verifier entry point for MIMIC-CXR report generation.

Called by Harbor after the agent completes. Reads
``/workspace/submission.json``, augments ``tests/task_answer_key.json``
in memory with gold FINDINGS + IMPRESSION parsed from
``/tests/target_report.txt`` (the ``bootstrap`` compose service wrote
this into the host's tests/ dir from PhysioNet before main started;
Harbor bakes it into the separate verifier image at verification time), then calls
CheXprompt and writes:

  * ``/logs/verifier/reward.txt``      — the binary reward scalar Harbor reads
        (the full ``{reward, n_tasks, n_pass, pass_rate}`` dict is in metrics.json)
  * ``/logs/verifier/metrics.json``    — same scalars + per-row
        diagnostics (study_id, candidate length, CheXprompt error
        counts by category, pass/fail).

Reward semantics: ``reward = 1.0`` iff every row in the submission has
zero clinically-significant CheXprompt errors; else ``0.0``. For the
1-row-per-trial layout this is identical to ``pass_rate``.

The aggregator at ``tasks/xray_report_correction/aggregate_metric.py``
pools these across trials (mean reward = pass rate across trials;
synthetic-zero for trials with no verifier output).

Required runtime env (verifier process only — agent never sees them):

  * ``CHEXPROMPT_OPENAI_API_KEY`` and optional
    ``CHEXPROMPT_OPENAI_BASE_URL`` (vanilla OpenAI), or
    ``CHEXPROMPT_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY``,
    ``CHEXPROMPT_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT``, and
    ``CHEXPROMPT_AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`` (Azure).
  * ``CHEXPROMPT_DEPLOYMENT``  — model / deployment name
    (e.g. ``gpt-4-1106-preview``).
