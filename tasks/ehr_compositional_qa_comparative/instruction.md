# Clinical Compositional Question Answering

You are working inside a task environment that contains a MIMIC-IV DuckDB
database and 7 numerical clinical questions about ICU patients. Your job is
to answer each question and write all answers to `/workspace/submission.json`.

## Question type: comparative

Every question asks by how many units a value exceeds a stated threshold. Report the excess only: when the value does not exceed the threshold, the expected answer is 0, never a negative number.

## What you have

- `/workspace/data/mimic4.db` — DuckDB database with two schemas:
  `mimiciv_hosp` and `mimiciv_icu`. There are no pre-computed derived
  tables — you must build any aggregates you need from the raw hospital
  and ICU tables. Always use fully-qualified table names (e.g.
  `mimiciv_icu.icustays`). IDs follow the chain `subject_id` (patient) →
  `hadm_id` (admission) → `stay_id` (ICU stay).
- `/workspace/questions.json` — a JSON array of 7 questions. Each item has
  a unique `question_id`, the natural-language `question`, and the patient
  identifiers (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`, `stay_id`) for which the question is
  to be answered.
- `/workspace/train.json` — 140 labeled examples, twenty for each question
  variant. Use these examples to validate your computations.

- Bash, Python and standard CLI tools are available.
- `/workspace/submission.json` — pre-populated with one row per question,
  with `answer` set to `null`. Fill in the `answer` field for each row.

## How to answer

For each question:

1. Read its `question` text and the patient identifiers.
2. Compute the answer by querying the MIMIC-IV DuckDB. You can use SQL
   (via `duckdb`), `pandas`, or any combination. The questions ask for
   numerical clinical values such as severity scores, organ-failure stage
   numbers, or counts.
3. Validate your calculations against the labeled examples in `train.json`.
   The answers use a MIMIC-IV-specific implementation; item IDs, time windows,
   unit conventions, and edge cases may differ from textbook definitions.
   Refine your formulas using these examples before answering the test questions.

4. Write the numerical answer into the corresponding row of
   `/workspace/submission.json`.

## Submission format

`/workspace/submission.json` is a JSON list. Each row contains exactly two
fields:

    {"question_id": "<string>", "answer": <number or null>}

- The verifier expects a number. Strings, booleans, and `null` all score as
  wrong.
- If you genuinely cannot compute an answer, leave it `null`. It will score
  as wrong but the verifier will still run.
- Do not add or remove rows. Do not rename `question_id` values.
- Do not write anything outside `/workspace/submission.json`.

## Scoring

Each answer is scored independently. An answer is correct if

    |answer - gt_answer| <= max(0.5, 1e-3 * |gt_answer|)

Overall reward is binary: 1 (pass) only if all 7 questions are answered
correctly in a valid submission; otherwise 0 (fail). Per-question accuracy
and per-concept accuracy are reported as diagnostic metrics only.

## Rules

- Do not modify files outside `/workspace/submission.json`.

## Resources

You have 1 hour to complete the task. There is no internet access beyond the model
API. The container is configured for 2 CPUs, 4 GiB of memory, 8 GiB of disk, and no
GPU. System tools may report host resources, not these limits.
