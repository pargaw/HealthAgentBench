Review the three MRI examinations in `/workspace/mri/exam_1/`, `/workspace/mri/exam_2/`,
and `/workspace/mri/exam_3/`. For each examination answer two questions:

- `acl`: Is there an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear? Count partial and
  complete tears; exclude isolated sprain, mucoid degeneration, and ganglion cyst.
- `meniscus`: Is there a meniscal tear? Count increased signal reaching a joint
  surface on at least two slices, or meniscal deformity. Exclude degeneration
  and postoperative changes without a tear.

Each examination directory contains the three MRI series exactly as released:
`axial.npy`, `coronal.npy`, and `sagittal.npy`. Each is a uint8 NumPy array
shaped `[number_of_slices, 256, 256]`, indexed `[slice, row, column]`. No
rendered images are provided; export or display whatever views you need from the
arrays. The three examinations are independent patients; answer each on its own
images.

Save `/workspace/submission.json` as one JSON object with exactly the keys
`exam_1`, `exam_2`, and `exam_3`. Each value must be an object with exactly the
keys `acl` and `meniscus`, each set to integer `1` (present) or `0` (absent). All
six answers must match the reference labels to pass.

Example output format (illustrative, not a diagnosis):
`{"exam_1": {"acl": 0, "meniscus": 1}, "exam_2": {"acl": 1, "meniscus": 1}, "exam_3": {"acl": 0, "meniscus": 0}}`
