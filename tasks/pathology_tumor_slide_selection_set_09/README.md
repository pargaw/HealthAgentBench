# `pathology_tumor_slide_selection_set_09`

This is one of 10 `pathology_tumor_slide_selection_*` tasks in the **Pathology Tumor Slide Selection** category of [HealthAgentBench](../../README.md).

The agent is given 8 whole-slide H&E pathology images under `/data/slides/` (opaque names `slide_1.svs` … `slide_8.svs`). Any number of them, possibly none, contain tumor; the agent is not told how many. The agent must inspect the slides with tooling of its own choosing and list every tumor-containing slide in `/workspace/submission.json`.

**Success criteria:** the submitted `tumor_slides` set exactly matches the set of slides whose hidden label is tumor (binary reward; slide-level precision/recall/F1 are also reported in `metrics.json`).

## Run this task

```bash
uv run harbor run \
  --path tasks/pathology_tumor_slide_selection_set_09 \
  --agent claude-code \
  --model claude-opus-4-8 \
  --agent-kwarg reasoning_effort=xhigh \
  --agent-kwarg disallowed_tools="WebSearch WebFetch" \
  --n-attempts 3 --n-concurrent 5
```

## Run the whole Pathology Tumor Slide Selection category

Point `--path` at `tasks/` and glob the category name with `--include-task-name` (quote it so the shell doesn't expand the `*`):

```bash
uv run harbor run \
  --path tasks \
  --include-task-name "pathology_tumor_slide_selection_*" \
  --agent claude-code \
  --model claude-opus-4-8 \
  --agent-kwarg reasoning_effort=xhigh \
  --agent-kwarg disallowed_tools="WebSearch WebFetch" \
  --n-attempts 3 --n-concurrent 5
```

## Data & references

Uses public whole-slide H&E diagnostic images from TCGA, downloaded at run time by the task's one-shot `bootstrap` service from the NCI Genomic Data Commons (no credentials required) into the shared cache `assets/tumor_slide_selection_pathology/assets/raw_cache/`. Slide-level labels are verifier-only and require an unambiguous pathologist review recorded in GDC for every slide: tumor slides are Primary Tumor / Metastatic samples whose pathologist-reviewed `percent_tumor_cells` is greater than 0, and normal slides are Solid Tissue Normal samples whose reviewed `percent_tumor_cells` is exactly 0. Slides without a recorded review are excluded from the pool.
