# Chest CT Multi-Abnormality Classification

You are working inside an environment that contains a single non-contrast
chest-CT volume and a list of clinical findings to evaluate. **For each
listed finding, decide whether the finding is present or absent in the
scan, and write your prediction.**

## Inputs

- `/workspace/data/scan.nii.gz` — the chest CT volume.
- `/workspace/data/labels.txt` — the clinical labels you must evaluate,
  one per line. Only these labels will be scored. The list is short
  (typically 4 to 12 labels) and is volume-specific.

## Output

Write a plain text file at `/workspace/submission/predictions.txt`
containing one `<label>: yes` or `<label>: no` line per requested label.
Use the exact label name from `labels.txt` (case-insensitive). Order
does not matter; the verifier matches by label name.

Format example:

    Cardiomegaly: no
    Pleural effusion: yes
    Lung nodule: no
    # comments and blank lines are ignored

## Rules

- The container has internet access. You are free to install whatever
  Python libraries, system packages, or tools you decide you need to
  inspect the volume and decide each label. How to actually look at a
  3-D volume is up to you to figure out.
- Solve the task using only the volume on disk. Do not try to look up
  the dataset's published labels or report on the internet.
- The reward is **binary** — you must get **every** requested label
  correct to score `1.0`. A single mistake yields `0.0`. Diagnostic
  per-label and per-disease F1 are reported alongside but do not affect
  the per-task reward.
- **You have up to 1 hour to complete this task.**

## Resources

The container is limited to the following, and Docker enforces these limits regardless of what system tools report:

- 2 CPUs
- 8 GiB of memory
- 8 GiB of disk
- no GPU

Tools such as `nproc`, `free -h`, `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo` and `os.cpu_count()` report the host machine (over 100 CPUs and terabytes of RAM), not this container's limits. Keep memory in mind when loading the full volume: a chest CT of several hundred slices is a few hundred MB as a float array, so slice-wise or downsampled reading is safer than loading everything at float64.
